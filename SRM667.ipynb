    "Problem Statement\n",
    "    \n",
    "You are given two distinct points A and B in the two-dimensional plane. Your task is to find any point C with the following properties:\n",
    "C is different from A and B.\n",
    "Each coordinate of C is an integer between -100 and 100, inclusive.\n",
    "The distance between A and C is strictly greater than the distance between B and C.\n",
    "You are given four integers: x1, y1, x2, and y2. Point A has coordinates (x1,y1) and point B has coordinates (x2,y2). Find the coordinates (x3,y3) of one possible point C with the above properties. Return these coordinates as a tuple (integer) with two elements: element 0 is x3 and element 1 is y3. In other words, return the tuple (integer) {x3,y3}.\n",
    "For the constraints given below it is guaranteed that a valid point C always exists. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.\n",
