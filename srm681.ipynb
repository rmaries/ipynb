    "Problem Statement\n",
    "    \n",
    "You have n coins, labeled 0 through n-1. Each of the coins shows either heads or tails. You are given the states of all coins in the string state with n characters. For each i, state[i] is 'H' if coin i shows heads, or 'T' if it shows tails.\n",
    "The coins are laid out in a row, ordered from coin 0 to coin n-1. A coin is called interesting if it differs from at least one of its neighbors. (For example, a coin that shows heads is interesting if at least one of its neighbors shows tails.) Return the number of interesting coins.\n",
