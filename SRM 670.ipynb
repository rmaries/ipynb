    "Given a plus/minus string, its negativity is the number of its prefixes that have a negative balance. For example, the negativity of the string \"++-+\" is 0, as none of its prefixes have a negative balance. The negativity of the string \"---\" is 3. Its three prefixes with a negative balance are \"-\", \"--\", and \"---\".\n",
    "You are given a string s that is a plus/minus string. You are also given an integer k. Your goal is to change s into a string with negativity at most k. In other words, you want to change s into a string that has at most k prefixes that have a negative balance.\n",
